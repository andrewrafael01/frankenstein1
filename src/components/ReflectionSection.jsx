          This project turns <em>Frankenstein</em> into a "Guilt Simulator" that asks players to make the same ethical evaluations critics and readers make, but through choices instead of a formal essay. Each scene presents a key moment from the novel — the creation in the lab, the De Lacey cottage, the glacier confrontation, the wedding night, and the Arctic ending — paired with direct quotations like "Learn from me… how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge," "I ought to be thy Adam… rather the fallen angel," and "I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend." The options the player picks adjust Victor's and the Creature's guilt scores, forcing them to decide whether suffering explains or excuses violence, and whether the "real" monster is the creator, the creation, or the fearful society that rejects him. The final verdict and rap-style closing statement make the interpretive stakes explicit: assigning blame becomes a thesis about responsibility, trauma, and agency in the novel. By the time the player reaches the end of the simulator, they have informally argued a position on who is guilty and why — just like a traditional paper would — but through interactive decisions, meters, and lyric commentary instead of a five-page essay.
